This project is very much in its infancy and is planned to be very big and I expect it to take at least a year for me to develop in my spare time. It is to help short wave radio listeners in their hobby of identifying and logging the various radio stations and signals that they pick up. It is currently at the stage whereby logs can be recorded and compared with data from external online sources.

For me, it is a perfect project for developing advanced practical web development skills, both front-end and back-end, and will include:

* Consuming and creating api endpoints
* Parsing data from external online sources, organising and inserting them into my own MYSQL database
* Tidying up and organising messy data from external sources, heavily dependent on regular expressions
* Calculating distances between longditude and latitude points on the globe
* Creative use of Javascript and CSS to display large volumes of data in a convenient and intuitive way
* Database optimisation in order to quickly sift through very large amounts of data
* Cron-like tasks for regularly retrieving data from external sources

There is much much more to come, in fact, the data currently on the site needs to be scrapped and the structure changed fundamentally
